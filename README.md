# _lodash
 Ten of the most popular Lodash methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays reimplemented in JavaScript (ECMAScript2020).
 If you wanted to use this library in your own projects right now, you could load it, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) link, in the <head> of your projectâ€™s index.html file, like so:
 
```html
<head>
  <script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.20/lodash.min.js'></script>
  <script src='file-that-uses-lodash.js'></script>
</head>
```

The following section contains the **official** [Lodash documentation]() (that I highly recommend you to visit) for the methods that I implemented in this repository.

## Methods:
